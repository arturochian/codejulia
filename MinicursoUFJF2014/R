generate.normal <- function(S,n,mu,sigma){

#  Note: for this very simple data generation, we can get the data
#  in one step like this, which requires no looping.  In more complex
#  statistical models, looping is often required to set up each
#  data set, because the scenario is much more complicated.  Here is
#  a loop to get the same data as above; try running the program and see
#  how much longer it takes!

#  dat <- NULL
#
#   for (i in 1:S){
#
#      Y <- rnorm(n,mu,sigma)
#      dat <- rbind(dat,Y)
#
#   }

   out <- list(dat=dat)
